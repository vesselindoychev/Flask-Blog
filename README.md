Blog Website created with Flask. Only admin has permissions to create, edit and delete blogs. There is authentication system, which allows to users logging in, logging out and registering to the website. Users are allowed only to read blogs and create comments.
This project was already created in another repo, so i replaced here and that's why it is added with only one commit.
